      <h4><img src="./Pics/C2.png" alt="Modern Controller"></h4>
      <p>This is just a general list of all the newer games,
      and the impact they are having on games today.</p>
		<div id="picText">Metal Gear 5</div>
        <h5><img src="./Pics/MG5.png" alt="Metal Gear 5 logo"></h5>
          <p>Recently released, and already contending for GOTY
          Metal Gear 5 gives the player true freedom to roam around
          and do whatever they want. Want to raid a base? Go for it.
          Want to do it in the middle of the day? Sure. Want to go in
          under the cover of a storm? Go for it. This is just a simple way 
          of looking at it, but the game offers a freedom not known yet
          to gaming. I'll also admit, it looks pretty sweet.</p>
		  <div id="picText">Killing Floor 2</div>
          <h5><img src="./Pics/KF2.png" alt="Killing Floor 2 logo"></h5>
          <p>Another personal favorite, it combines the classic zombie
          killing action, with one of the most advanced gore systems
          known to gaming (as of 2015.) Still in Early Access on Steam,
          the game is already in a playable state, that ha vey few bugs 
          at all in it. Constantly being updated as well,
          Tripwire Interactive knows just how to keep the fanbase
          returning to their game.</p>
		  <div id="picText">Witcher 3</div>
          <h5><img src="./Pics/W3.jpg" alt="Witcher 3 logo"></h5>
          <p>Created by CD Projekt Red, the Witcher 3 is one of the few RPG's 
          that truly looked at the choice/consequence system that Deus Ex had,
          and actually implemented it. I could go so far as to say it's one of
          the best modern day RPG's out there, one that will be looked back on
          as being truly groundbreaking and revolutionary.</p>
