      <h4><img src="./Pics/C1.png" alt="Joystick"></h4>
      <p>This is just a general list of all the classic games,
      and the role they played in gaming history.</p>
		<div id="picText">Doom</div>
        <h5><img src="./Pics/doom.png" alt="Doom Logo"></h5>
          <p>Well, here it is. The game that is heralded as the start
          of the First Person Shooter genre and was developed by 
          Id Software. One of the reasons too we still have video games
          around today. This game goes at the top of the list because 
          when you think classics, you can't help but think DOOM first.</p>
		  <div id="picText">Deus Ex</div>
          <h5><img src="./Pics/Deus.png" alt="Deus Ex Logo"></h5>
          <p>Personal favorite, Deus Ex is regarded as one of the greatest
          role playings games of all time even despite its age today.
          The common joke "Every time somebody mentions Deus Ex somebody
          else goes to reinstall it" is soemthing that still goes on today.
          Developed by Ion Storm, it includes a lot of themes and explores
          conspiracy theories that are still discussed at length today.
          Good choice/consequence game as well, player actions early on
          can really come back to help or bite you later on!</p>
		  <div id="picText">Half Life</div>
          <h5><img src="./Pics/HL.png" alt="Half Life Logo"></h5>
          <p>Developed by Valve Software, you play as a mute scientist
          with a crowbar. What is there to not love? Another classic
          in the FPS genre, it was also heralded for its puzzles that
          really challenged the player to use their mind. And of course
          when one mentions Half Life the question of when the 3rd 
          installment is coming out usually follows short behind.
          So, I'll be the first to ask, when is HL3 happening Valve?</p>
