This is just a javascript project that i created to show my love of Doom, 
and to play around with js some. Always looking for feedback and hoping
to continue updating the game, with more levels, a proper start menu,
and anything else i come up with! Other then that the control are pretty basic,
WASD to move, Left mouse button to fire and have at it!
